# All-About-Node.js
The complication of this repository are works from a course taken on Udemy. Here's a link to the course here: https://www.udemy.com/the-definitive-nodejs-developer-course Below, you are able to view a short description of each of the programs that are listed. In order to run any of these: navigate to the directory and run: <code> node app.js </code>

## 1_hello_world
This folder contains simple functionality of logging the user's name and time to a log.txt when the program is run.


## 2_food_bot
This folder contains a simple program for AI. This will take your order and dynamically let you know your change.


## 2_exports
This folder contains a lot of different ways you're able to export functions with Node.js. All of the functions are called from app.js and you can easily see all of the different messages files to view how they were exported.

## 3_emitters
This folder contains 2 different app.js files. The app.js file is a simple collection of event listeners and emitters. You can view that this is a simple program that replicates someone ringing someone else's doorbell.
